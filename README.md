# Heart-Failure-Prediction
The prediction is based on various parameters which are used to predict whether heart failure would ccure or not. 
The data is consists of classification values. However, the output data is in Descrete (Binary in this case). So I have used classification algorithms to predict the dependent variable.
I have used ANN to train the model.
The Algorithms used are:

1. 1D CNN
2. RNN
