# Heart-Failure-Prediction
The prediction is based on various parameters which are used to predict whether heart failure would ccure or not. 
The data is consists of classification values. However, the output data is in Descrete (Binary in this case). So I have used classification algorithms to predict the dependent variable. The Algorithms used are:

K-Neighbors Classifier (KNN)
Support Vector Classifier
Naive Bayes
